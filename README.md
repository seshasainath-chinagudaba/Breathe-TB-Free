# Breathe-TB-Free: A Tool to Help Predict Tuberculosis Outcomes

**Breathe-TB-Free** is a web-based tool designed to help doctors and healthcare workers predict the outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. It also assesses how likely TB is to spread among people who have been in close contact with TB patients. By using advanced machine learning models, the platform aims to assist healthcare providers in making better decisions about treating TB and preventing its spread.

## What Does the Platform Do?

The main goals of **Breathe-TB-Free** are:
- To **predict how well a patient will respond to TB treatment**—whether they’re likely to recover fully, experience complications, or relapse after treatment.
- To **assess the risk of spreading TB** among people in close contact with the patient, helping public health officials prioritize testing and treatment.
  
It’s a web-based tool, so healthcare professionals can easily access it through a web browser. They simply enter patient data, and the system gives them predictions based on models trained on TB-related data.

## Key Features

### 1. **Easy-to-Use Web Interface**
   The platform has a user-friendly design, powered by the Flask web framework. It allows users to upload patient data and get predictions directly from their web browser. The platform also features a logo on every page for consistent branding, and it’s designed to work well on all kinds of devices (like computers and phones).

### 2. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**
   The platform uses two main machine learning models:
   - **XGBoost Model**: This is a powerful model that analyzes patient data to predict TB treatment outcomes. The data might include things like the patient’s age, medical history, and details about their TB infection.
   - **CatBoost Encoder**: This tool helps the model handle categorical data—things like patient gender, location, or type of treatment—so the model can better understand these inputs and make more accurate predictions.

Together, these models predict things like the likelihood of treatment success, the risk of relapse, and how likely the disease is to spread among close contacts of the patient.

### 3. **How the Backend Works**
   - **`app.py`**: This file is the brain of the platform. It connects the front-end (the web pages users see) to the machine learning models. When users enter data, `app.py` processes it and sends it to the models to generate predictions.
   - **`home.py`**: This file manages the homepage, handles user interactions (like form submissions), and displays results.
   - **Static Files and Templates**: The platform uses standard HTML and CSS files to design and style the web pages. These files are stored in the `static/` and `templates/` folders.

### 4. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   The platform takes raw patient data, cleans it, and prepares it for analysis by the machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, scaling numbers so they’re easy for the models to interpret, and encoding categorical data (like patient gender or location) so the models can work with it.

### 5. **Model Performance**
   The machine learning models are evaluated using several metrics to ensure they’re accurate and reliable:
   - **Accuracy**: How often the model gets the prediction right.
   - **Precision and Recall**: Precision tells how well the model avoids false positives, and recall measures how well it catches all true positives.
   - **F1-Score**: A balanced measure of both precision and recall.
   - **AUC-ROC**: This evaluates how well the model distinguishes between different outcomes.

These results are displayed in an easy-to-understand way, using visual tools like graphs and charts.

## How to Set Up the Platform

### Prerequisites
To get the platform running on your computer, you’ll need:
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Flask**: A web framework that runs the platform.
- Other necessary Python packages, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Steps to Run the Platform

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open a terminal and run the following command to download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seshasainath-chinagudaba/Breathe-TB-Free.git
   cd Breathe-TB-Free
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the web application with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Platform**: Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to start using the platform.

## How to Use the Platform

1. **Upload Patient Data**: From the homepage, you can input or upload TB patient information.
2. **Get Predictions**: The platform will process the data and use the models to give you predictions about the patient’s treatment outcome and the risk of TB spreading.
3. **Analyze the Results**: The predictions are presented in a simple format, allowing you to quickly assess the patient’s risks.

## Future Plans

The project is still growing, and here are some planned improvements:
- **Better Model Interpretations**: We plan to add tools that explain how the models arrive at their predictions.
- **Wider Data Sources**: We’ll expand the dataset to include information from more regions and populations, improving the model’s accuracy.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Eventually, we’ll make the platform available on the cloud so it can be accessed by anyone, anywhere.
